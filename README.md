# WebGL Experiments

This project is a kind of a pedagogical sandbox/showcase on the following tech and aspects:
- React (Hooks)
- Typescript
- WebGL
- SASS

Features what can be expected from a modern front repository setup:
- Webpack/Babel
- Eslint/Prettier/Husky

The goal is to later on build a game engine that can be run inside the browser, and can be easily understood, improved and eventually port to other techs/stacks.
